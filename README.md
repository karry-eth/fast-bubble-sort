## Bubble Sort Project

This project implements the classic bubble sort algorithm in JavaScript. Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted.


## Example usage:

```
const array = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90];
const sortedArray = bubbleSort(array);
console.log(sortedArray);
```
